Sorry, no time to document right now. Read the source code or email me.

You need at least:

-Vala 0.14.0 or later
-Gstreamer 0.10.something (probably like 0.10.26?)
-Recent libmpdclient
-An mpd server
-An icecast or shoutcast server

Q: Why did I write this?

A: To push tags from mpd through this pipeline out-of-band.

(This is my setup, and tribblify will replace the "gstreamer script" part.)
