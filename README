Tribblify is a program that streams a live PulseAudio source (either a physical sound card input like a microphone, or the monitor of an output sink) to a given Icecast or Shoutcast server.

It doesn't *just* stream the PulseAudio audio data, though; it also extracts Spotify song title and artist information from the X11 window, so your stream is tagged.

You need at least:

-Vala 0.30.0 or later
-Gstreamer 1.x
-GDK 3.x
-libwnck-3.0
-An icecast or shoutcast server
-PulseAudio 1.x or a later version that's supported by your gstreamer pulseaudio module
-PulseAudio must be running and have at least one device, and you have to know that device's name at launch time of tribblify
-The proprietary, official Spotify client for Linux (conceivably for other X11 based systems, but I don't think Spotify runs on any X11 operating system other than Linux right now)

Q: Why did I write this?

A: To push tags from Spotify through this pipeline out-of-band.

## Development Note

Yes, previously, this program just pushed tags from mpd. Now it has been rewritten for Spotify specifically.

The mpd code may be integrated back into this modernized codebase using gst-1.0, etc. at a later date.
